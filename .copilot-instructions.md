# Copilot Instructions for GitHub Issues Dashboard

## Testing Guidelines
- Always create temporary test files instead of running Python commands directly in terminal
- Use descriptive test file names with timestamp for uniqueness
- Automatically clean up test files after execution
- Test files should be self-contained and include error handling

## Code Patterns
- Use file-based testing for database queries and data analysis
- Include comprehensive error handling in all test scripts
- Always close database connections properly
- Use context managers where possible

## Debugging Workflow
1. Create test file with descriptive name
2. Run test file to gather information
3. Analyze results
4. Clean up test file automatically
5. Apply fixes to main code

## File Management
- Keep only essential files in the repository
- Remove temporary test files after use
- Maintain clean workspace structure

## Windows Environment Considerations
- Use proper PowerShell syntax for file operations
- Handle file paths with backslashes correctly
- Use appropriate Python execution methods for Windows

## External Program Execution
- **NEVER assume external programs are in PATH environment variable**
- Before running external programs (az, azd, docker, git, etc.), always check if they exist
- Use full paths when possible or check common installation locations
- Provide clear installation instructions if programs are missing
- Examples of programs that may not be in PATH:
  - Azure CLI (`az`)
  - Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)
  - Docker (`docker`)
  - Git (`git`)
  - Node.js/npm (`node`, `npm`)
- When programs fail with "not recognized" errors, guide user to install or add to PATH
- Consider using Windows-specific installation methods (winget, chocolatey, manual installers)
